It's here to provide a contact possibility for old friends or former colleagues. If you neither belong to the old friends category nor to former colleagues, then please <strong>first write me an E-Mail</strong>! I don't want to be cold-called by people having PEBKAC problems with Open Source software or head hunters! Asynchronous communication has been invented for a reason.</p>

  <p>Due to "popular demand": Lubeque has <strong>GMT+1</strong> and <strong>GMT+2</strong> in summertime.</p>
