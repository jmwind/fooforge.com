          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>I'm working in the IT for about half my life so far. Needless to say that I've developed some kind of passion for information technologies early on. I'd even say that my ongoing interest is the key motivation for keeping up good work. What's work worth if you don't flavor it with at least a pinch of dedication?</p>
          <h4>Load ,8,1</h4>
          <p>I've started playing around with computers at the age of nine when my father bought a Commodore 64. Guess I have to thank him for his interest in technology. I can still remember the day when he bought a couple megabytes of RAM for his newly acquired Intel 80286. These days the C64 became mine.</p>
          <h4>Basic or Pascal?</h4>
          <p>To be honest: During my youth I used computers for almost anything except programming. It took quite some time till I've began exploring various programming languages like Quick basic, Turbo Pascal or Delphi. And I never built anything special in my early years.<br />I even thought I'd never make a living of working with computers at some point. Luckily that changed with the uprising of GNU/Linux and the Open Source scene.</p>
          <h4>sysctl -a | fgrep tcp</h4>
          <p>Today I'm an expert in terms of Unix/Linux administration, infrastructure development, application scaling and tuning as well as monitoring for the whole stack. I'm a freelancing author, an operations guy by choice, a Ruby enthusiast and frequent Hacker News reader.</p>
