This repository contains the data for my personal [portfolio](http://fooforge.com/). It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) into a static site every 30 minutes triggered by a [chef-run](http://opscode.com/chef) executing the [jekyll cookbook](https://github.com/fooforge/chef-cookbook_jekyll).

If you want to reuse some of its parts for your own project please see below.

If you do use some or all of those resources, a link back to [me](http://fooforge.com/) or the Jekyll project's [website](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) would be appreciated, but is not required.
