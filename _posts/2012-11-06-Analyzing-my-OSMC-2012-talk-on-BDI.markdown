title: Analyzing my OSMC 2012 talk on BDI
subtitle: "Putting on my birthday suit..."
---

It's a little late, but here are the [slides](http://speakerdeck.com/fooforge/cucumber-nagios) from my talk at this year's [Open Source Monitoring Conference](http://www.netways.de/en/osmc/osmc_2012/uebersicht/) in Nuremberg, Germany about [cucumber-nagios](http://auxesis.github.com/cucumber-nagios/) and *Behavior-Driven infrastructure* in general.

Oh, you're still with me? Alright, â€¦ here's what I think:

## The verdict

The talk got a 4.0 rating on [SpeakerRate](http://speakerrate.com/talks/16231-cucumber-nagios-a-deep-dive-into-behavior-driven-infrastructure) and from what I heard so far people gave good feedback which makes me feel pleased overall.

During Q&A there were some pretty interesting questions, e.g. whether the BDI approach would also work in scenarios where collaboration between two or more companies is mandatory. There were also people asking for a more detailed explanation of a few key concepts of [cucumber](http://cukes.info) which frankly speaking isn't a good sign. But well, it at least shows that I didn't lose all their attention during the talk.

People came by afterwards and wanted to know more about [cucumber-nagios](http://auxesis.github.com/cucumber-nagios/) and the *Behavior-Driven Infrastructure* approach. This led to another half an hour of good talking about those topics and the DevOps movement in general before I had to leave the venue in order to catch my train.

What also went rather well is giving the talk in English, I suppose. I didn't have any major problems with finding the right words or mumbling. Me (german native) saying `developers` might've been a little too Steve Balmer'ish though - without the voice cracking.

Overall I think I performed well for not being "on stage" for a couple years though lots of things could've been done better. This is why I analyzed my performance afterwards in order to define a few learnings to be applied next time.

Those are the things that didn't go too well:

### Fonts

Courier New, *Regular*, **you're dismissed!** Source code written in Courier New looks marvellous on slides, especially on dark backgrounds, but projected on a wall it's a bloody mess. It was probably readable for people in the front row, but that's about it. I had to improvise and to read out loud lots of code examples in order to explain stuff for my audience in the back.

This was probably the most annoying part of the whole talk.

### Slide colors

I got [great feedback](https://twitter.com/auxesis/status/265341399061393408) on the design of my slides. At the venue it was a bit too bright for dark slides and light font colors. And I should've known since I attended quite a few conferences in Nuremberg during the last couple years.

Bright backgrounds on slides might not be the most visually appealing approach, but it would've been easier to read.

### Content

Some aspects of the subject were a bit underrepresented. I know it's almost impossible to put every aspect in a 45 minute presentation, but I'm pretty sure that I lost a few people due to the way I explained coherencies. The central theme could've been even more clear.

### Pace

**A presentation is not a race!** Again. **It is not a race!**

I designed the talk to be around 45 minutes long with 15 minutes left for Q&A. Somehow I managed to finish the presentation in about 30 to 35 minutes and I realized far too late that I've been talking too fast. I tried to ease up a bit during the last third of my talk, but it was already a little late for changing the pace.

This could've been easily avoided with more practice. For some reason I decided against recording myself during practice which might've helped me to find the right pace.

### Style

No cheesy jokes about local peculiarities when presenting in front of an international audience next time. I still don't know what made me think that this would work. Luckily I only did this at the very beginning for a very short time and went ahead on-topic pretty fast.

## Learnings:

* More emphasis on font style and colors
* Ease up on stage. No need to hurry...
* No dull jokes on local peculiarities
* And most important: **More practice!**

**More practice!** This is probably the most important learning this year. Watching people like [Chad Fowler](https://twitter.com/chadfowler), [Corey Haines](https://twitter.com/coreyhaines), <strike>[Gorby Thunderhorse](https://twitter.com/gorbypuff)</strike>, [Aaron Patterson](https://twitter.com/tenderlove) or [Steve Klabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik) makes it easy to forget how much effort it takes to give a consistent, appealing talk on a topic that matters.

It seems that they've familiarized with the situation presenting in front of a large audience long ago. But what caused the familiarization presumably is just practice, practice and even more practice.

I doubt that I'll be able to give *the perfect talk* on the next occasion, but at least I discovered quite a few areas for improvement.
