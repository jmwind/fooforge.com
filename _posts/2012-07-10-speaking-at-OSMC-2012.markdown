title: Speaking at OSMC 2012
subtitle: "Talking about how you'd improve your monitoring!"
---

I am a speaker at the [Open Source Monitoring Conference 2012](http://www.netways.de/en/osmc/osmc_2012/uebersicht/) which is happening in Nuremberg, Germany from 17th to 18th October. Some might remember that this was already planned last year, but I sadly had to decline my appearance due to health reasons.

Nevertheless, this year it's a different story and I'm therefore definitely going to talk about [cucumber-nagios](http://auxesis.github.com/cucumber-nagios/) written by the fabulous [Lindsay Holmwood](http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/).

If you're unsure about attending the OSMC here're a few reasons why you should attend:

* Around 200 people focusing Monitoring and Infrastructure topics on a two track conference
* The venue is being held at a comfortable 4 star business hotel, located in central Nuremberg
* Organized by [Netways](http://www.netways.de/en/de/home/), one of Germany's leading Open Source backers
* Lots of bavarian joviality and, of course, great brew

If you're interested head over to the [conference registration](http://www.netways.de/en/osmc/osmc_2012/registration/) and meet me in Nuremberg! I'm also on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fooforge). Follow me for the latest updates.
