**Mission accomplished!**  
After almost three years here in Hamburg I'm leaving [XING](https://www.xing.com/) at the end of [Movember](http://www.movember.com). Rest assured, it's been an interesting three years long ride for me and I'd like to say thanks to all the people I had the chance to work with!

Working on a large infrastructure a little burdened by legacy and turning it into a more stable, future-oriented one was definitely worth the time. Moving data centers over a 500 kilometers distance without major downtimes as well. And being a member of the team which kicked off the new development infrastructure at XING also was an interesting affair.

I'm really thankful for the experience here in Hamburg! I'll definitely be around from time to time, attending the same meet-ups or conferences.

So, what's next?

**Whoa space-lord mother[*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5ttxK7SOC8) ...**  
I'll jump on an A380 on 2nd December to meet my new comrades in the Bay Area though I'll generally remain in Europe getting the job done remotely. Ping me if you're up for a beer (or night photography) in San Francisco! I'll be around from 12/2 till 12/16.
