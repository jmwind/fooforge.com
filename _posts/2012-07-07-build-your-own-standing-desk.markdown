I've been sitting in front of a computer for quite a while now. Nearly half my life I've been sitting for getting things done, I guess. Time for a change!

At least that's what I've been thinking every single time after reading about standing desks in the past three years. Although reading those articles at [Ikea hackers](http://www.ikeahackers.net/2011/01/wide-standing-desk.html), [lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5735528/why-and-how-i-switched-to-a-standing-desk) or the [New York Times](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/stand-up-while-you-read-this/) was enlightening I just wasn't able to go for a standing desk.  
On the one hand I wasn't convinced enough to throw much money at the problem, on the other I thought I just suck at handcraft and never would be able to assemble IKEA stuff in a different way than the manual says.

Boy, I was wrong. And all that was needed was [Colin Nederkoorn from Customer.io](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html) writing about the possibly cheapest method to create a standing desk. If your local IKEA has all the parts Colin mentioned you'll get a solution for around 40 Euro which is not only easy to build, but also pleasent to look at.

### To the shopping mall!

In my case I had to invest a little more. Around 50 Euro for the standing desk stuff and another 100 bucks for a new desk since I wanted to preserve the ability to use my old desk as well.

Here's my IKEA shopping list:

* [2 LACK side tables](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90218151/#/80104268)
* [2 EKBY JAERPEN shelfs](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90025044/#/20094347)
* [2 EKBY VALTER brackets](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/56696109/#/80167473)
* [1 VIKA AMON/VIKA ANNEFORS desk](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S99874111/)

Please note that I had to buy different shelfs than Colin mentioned since my local IKEA was out of stock. Mine are about three times the weight and double the length. Therefore I had to make a stop at the hardware store to buy M6/80mm bolts and double-sided tape. Sidenote: Do not buy 100mm bolts. They're too long. <small>I had to drive to the store twice because of this.</small>

### Get your hands dirty!

When it comes to putting the thing together you first need to adjust the height of the shelf. Once there're attached to the LACK's table legs the height is fixed. Make sure that the shelf is at or slightly below elbow height.
Head over to the [Tinkering Monkey](http://www.tinkeringmonkey.com/site/do-your-back-a-favor-get-a-standing-desk/) to see some nice graphics about ergonomics of a standing desk.

The LACK table's legs are hollow, at least in Europe. Those bolts make sure that the brackets are able to handle the weight of the shelf safely. With just a few screws or dowels you might get into trouble. Also, the drill holes on the VALTER brackets are too narrow out of the box. You have to widem them carefully so that an M6/80mm bolt fits.

The double-sided tape is needed to keep the LACK tables in place since the shelfs are a bit too heavy. This is not much of a problem, the construction itself doesn't tip over without a little pressure. I just wanted to make sure that I don't get buried under a standing desk.

The second shelf acts as a monitor stand. You might need to add a few books or as in my case a couple small, old shelfs to elevate it into the correct position. I also put some old unused weights in between the shelf and the LACK tables to make the construction even more stable. <small>For the beer-driven development nights, you know?!</small>

### Enjoy the result! <small>And dance!</small>

That's it. Enjoy the result, stand up to get things done. And when your feet starts to hurt simply switch into **dancing-driven development** mode!
